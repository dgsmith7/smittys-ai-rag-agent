# Sara - smittys-ai-rag-agent

SARA, an acronym for Smitty's AI RAG Agent, is an Artificial Intelligence Retrieval-Augmentation Generation System pipeline based on open-source tools. I intend to deploy this completed LLM RAG pipeline locally for my own assistance, and elsewhere as the basis for future projects that require a domain-specific corpus of knowledge to guide responses to user prompts.

The repo based on the folllowing article.

I am currently running on a 2023 14-inch MacBookPro with M3 Pro Chip and 36GB Unified RAM. It is a little slow to respond but not too terrible. I am using the QWEN3:14b model.
