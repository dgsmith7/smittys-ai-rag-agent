# Sara - smittys-ai-rag-agent

Sara, an acronym for Smitty's AI RAG Agent is an Artificial Intelligence Retrieval-Augmentation Generation System pipeline based on open-source tools. I intend to deploy this completed LLM RAG pipeline locally for my own assistance, and elsewhere as the basis for future projects that require a domain-specific corpus of knowledge to guide responses to user prompts.

The repo based on the folllowing article.
